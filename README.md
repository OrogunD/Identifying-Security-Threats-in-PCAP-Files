Project: Identifying Security Threats in PCAP Files

This project is a collection of Python scripts and tools designed to analyze network traffic captured in PCAP files and detect potential security threats and anomalies. The tools are aimed at assisting in the identification of various types of security issues that may be present in network communications.

Subfolders:

1. Analyzing DHCPframe:
   - Contains a tool to analyze DHCP frames within PCAP files.
   - Helps identify DHCP-related anomalies or attacks.

2. Generic Tool to Analyze More Threats:
   - A versatile utility designed to analyze different types of PCAP files.
   - Useful for detecting a wide range of security threats.

3. Extracting the Global Header of the PCAP File:
   - Provides a script to extract and display the global header information from a PCAP file.

4. Analyzing Suspected Websites:
   - Offers a script to analyze suspected websites within a PCAP file.
   - Provides insights into potentially malicious or unauthorized activities.

5. Website User Access Analysis:
   - Focuses on analyzing user access to websites from network traffic.
   - Aids in detecting unusual patterns of website access.

These tools collectively contribute to enhancing network security by identifying and analyzing potential security threats in PCAP files. Each subfolder contains specific scripts and instructions for usage.

Contributions to the project are welcome. Feel free to explore the subfolders, contribute enhancements, and help make network traffic analysis more effective in identifying security vulnerabilities.
